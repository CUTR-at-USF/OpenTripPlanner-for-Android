OpenTripPlanner for Android does not collect any information about you or your device.  Note that to plan a trip, the origin and destination of the trip is sent to an OpenTripPlanner server so a path between those points is returned.  The OpenTripPlanner server may store those origins and destinations.  These servers are independently maintained for each geographic region - a list of public OTP servers is kept in the [OTP Server Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgWy8ujaGosCdDhxTC04cUZNeHo0eGFBQTBpU2dxN0E&hl=en_US&authkey=CK-H__IP#gid=1) (a Google Docs spreadsheet).  You can contact each of these regions to find out more about their specific privacy policies.

Please note that OpenTripPlanner for Android uses the [Android Maps API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/).  To see Google's privacy policy for the Android Maps API v2, which is operated by Google, please see the Android Maps API v2 [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms).
